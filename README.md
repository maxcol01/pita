### Use of AI Tools

In accordance with CS50’s Final Project guidelines, AI tools were used solely as helpers and not as substitutes for original work.  
**JetBrains AI (Junie)** was used to assist in generating portions of the front-end (HTML/CSS).  
All AI-assisted code has been examined, modified when necessary, and fully understood by the author.  
The core design, logic, and implementation decisions remain entirely my own.
